# Duck or Goose
## Duck or Goose is a web app designed to sacrifice coders. It uses a fair and random system to choose between them.

## Features

- Add & remove potential victims
- Kill coders randomly

> The main goal is to create a random selector that gives us a name that will be removed from the game until there's no one left to sacrifice. 
> Another function is to add new victims to the game as needed, and remove existing ones.

## Tech

Duck or Goose uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Sass] 
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js]
- [jQuery]
- [owlCarousel]

## Resources

Duck or Goose uses:

- [Media Queries simplified for Sass] - Sass mixin used to simplify Media Queries
- [Fog Animation]
- [Animista Animations]

## Installation

Duck or Goose uses Sass and requires [Node.js] v10+ to be installed.

To install Sass:
